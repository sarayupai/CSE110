#About Me

My name is Sarayu Pai and I'm a junior at UCSD pursuing a major in Bioinformatics.

One quote about computer science by Edsger Dijkstra that I enjoy is the following:
>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

One of my favorite books is *Murder on the Orient Express*
